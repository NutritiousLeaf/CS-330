This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in both the technical and creative aspects of computational graphics using C++ and OpenGL. I developed a complete 3D scene, submitted alongside the full Visual Studio project and source code, as well as a detailed Design Decisions document explaining my process and the reasoning behind my choices. Together, these components highlight not only my technical expertise but also my ability to approach graphical challenges with a critical and innovative mindset.

From the outset, my design process was user-focused. I began by envisioning a realistic desk environment populated with everyday objects—a laptop, books, a mug, and a lamp. Rather than tackling the scene all at once, I broke the project down into modular elements: individual meshes, shader programs, lighting systems, and texture maps. Each component was developed and validated independently, ensuring reliability before integration into the larger scene. This object-oriented approach facilitated efficient testing and iteration.

Throughout development, I refined my skills in several key areas, especially lighting and texture mapping. Achieving a realistic appearance required balancing ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting models, as well as applying advanced texture wrapping and filtering to enhance surface detail. I sketched out initial scene layouts, identified reusable geometric shapes (such as cylinders for mugs and lamp arms), and adjusted object positions to create a visually balanced composition.

My workflow followed an iterative cycle: design, implement, test, and refine. I regularly compiled and reviewed the rendered scene, making incremental adjustments to improve visual fidelity and prevent errors from compounding. Version control played a crucial role, allowing me to experiment confidently with lighting, camera controls, and texture integration, while maintaining a well-organized and modular codebase.

Participating in this project deepened my understanding of how computational graphics can transform abstract concepts into tangible visualizations. The technical and creative skills I developed here are broadly applicable—not only in areas like game development, visualization, or AR/VR—but also in data science, simulation, and user experience design. The ability to conceptualize and debug in 3D space, as well as to implement complex shader logic, will be invaluable in both academic research and professional software engineering contexts.

Ultimately, this project represents a significant milestone in my academic journey. It has solidified my goal of becoming a software engineer with a strong foundation in both backend logic and frontend visualization. The experience of building a realistic 3D scene from the ground up—bridging theory and practice—marks a key step in my growth within the Computer Science program and provides a substantial artifact for my portfolio.
